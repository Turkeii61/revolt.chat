We have some exciting news to share with all of you today. Revolt has hit 100,000 users (and counting). Your eyes don't deceive you. That is 5 zeros after that 1. How crazy is that? 

It's been an incredible journey, and we couldn't have done it without all of you. We want to take a moment to express our deepest gratitude for your continued support and enthusiasm. 

## Getting to 100K 
It's not been an instantaneous process, far from it. Revolt first launched at the start of 2021 in a private beta, and it wasn't until we entered public beta in August of that year that we started increasing in user count. We got our first real public exposure in September of 2021 when we became featured on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28434012) and [It's FOSS](https://itsfoss.com/revolt/). 

This year has been the biggest year in growth though. We've received mentions on the YouTube channels of both [SomeOrdinaryGamers](https://youtu.be/1yUj_Jdis6E?t=271) and [No Text To Speech](https://youtu.be/47EjvPIhAOU). That really sent us skyrocketing and was our biggest user boost until we introduced discriminators. Apparently, you guys really like them because 10,000 of you have joined since we [announced them a mere 2 days ago](evolving-usernames). 

If you're interested in the full story of our path to this point, then you should check out the [timeline on our wiki](https://wiki.rvlt.gg/index.php/Revolt_Timeline). 

Once again, thank you very much everyone for the continued support. We will see you again at 3 morbillion users. #revoltsweep
