It's time to come clean. We've been working on a secret project for a while now, and we're finally ready to share it with you. We're excited to announce that we're launching a mobile app for Android users!

## Current state of Android

For years now, our Android app has simply been a [TWA](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/) wrapper around the web version of Revolt. While this was a good start, it had its limitations.

For instance, it depended on your current default browser, so we couldn't control all of the experience. Some Firefox users even reported seeing a navigation bar, which we absolutely want to avoid! This approach also limited us to the features that are available to a web app. We couldn't use any native features, such as push notifications, and we couldn't use any of the native UI elements.

All-in-all, it was a subpar experience, and we wanted to improve it. So we did.

## Introducing: Revolt on Android

A year of hard work in the making, here it is: Revolt on Android. It's a native app, built from the ground up in Kotlin, with all the features you know and love from the web version. It's fast, it's smooth, and it's beautiful.

## When can I get it?

It's still cooking in the oven, but we're planning to release it in the coming months. We'll be releasing it as a beta first, so you'll be able to try it out before it's released to the public.

## What about iOS?

There's not much to say about this yet, but we're working on it. We'll share more info when we have it!

## Where can I get more info?

I'll be posting more updates, infos and builds on [**Jenvolt**](https://rvlt.gg/jen), so make sure to join if you want to stay up-to-date with everything related to Revolt on Android.

With that being said, I hope you're as excited as we all are. See you on Revolt!
