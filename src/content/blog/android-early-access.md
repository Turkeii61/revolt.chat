It's been [more than a year](http://revolt.chat/updates/revolt-on-the-go) since we first announced our plans to bring Revolt to mobile devices with a fresh, native experience. Today, we're excited to announce that Revolt for Android is now available as Early Access on the Google Play Store!

## What's in the Early Access?

The Early Access version of Revolt for Android is a work-in-progress-maybe-buggy-maybe-crashy version of the app.

It doesn't have all the features of the web version yet, but it's a great way to stay connected with your friends and communities on the go. All of the core features are there, including:

-   **Chatting**: Send messages, images, and files to your friends and communities.
-   **Editing your profile**: Change your username, avatar, and status.
-   **Joining communities**: Find new communities to join or discover new ones with Discover.
-   **Customisation**: Change the app's theme, language, and more in the settings.

The app is of course following all the principles you can expect for an Android app, including Material Design 3 (yes, this also means Material You), system integration, and more. We're also working on making the app more accessible and inclusive.

## How to join the Early Access

**Simply download the app from the Google Play Store and start using it!** You can find the app by searching for &ldquo;Revolt&rdquo; on the Google Play Store or by clicking the slightly oversized badge below:

## What's next for Revolt for Android?

Here's a sneak peek of what you can expect in the future:

-   **Voice and video calls**: Stay connected with your friends and communities with voice and video calls.
-   **Screen sharing**: Share your screen in voice and video calls.
-   **Push notifications**: Get notified when someone mentions you or sends you a message.
-   **Performance improvements**: Make the app faster and more reliable.

We're also still working on bringing Revolt to iOS, so stay tuned for more updates on that front!
