Hey chat!

Didn't expect us to be so back so quickly, did you? Well, we're back, and we're back with a bang.
This update brings you a brand new colour picker, and it's a doozy.

## Colour Picker

At Revolt, we've always been a bit more about customisation than the other guys. And what's more
customisable than colours? This is why we've been shipping Material You support since our very
first internal builds.

Of course, Material You may not be for everyone. So we've also had a colour override system in place
that lets you customise the colours of the app to your heart's content, as well as import and export
themes into cryptic `RATO` files.

But there was always one thing missing: a good colour picker. The old one was a bit... well, let's
just say it was a bit lacking. So we've gone ahead and built a brand new colour picker from the
ground up, built to compete with what the iOS team has recently built into their system.

Of course, team iOS is at an advantage here, because they have a system-wide colour picker. Android
historically hasn't had one, so we had to build our own. Here's our new colour picker:

![Sliders tab](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/fFmNZinvfdWroWWfLEEC5yF7G3MrIS0x09K2AN6DeT)

The new colour picker has three tabs: **Sliders**, **Palette**, and **Hex**. The **Sliders** tab
lets you pick colours using HSV sliders, which is especially helpful for picking colours that are
harmonious with each other, which you probably want to do if you're customising the app's colours.

![Palette tab](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/vQXKvZikyoEBN6fBGLjHj_DKQJ9XN12s_H9-7hMrB4)

The **Palette** tab lets you pick colours from a predefined palette. This is especially helpful if
you're not sure what colours you want to use, or if you're just looking for a quick colour to use.
Our palette is from the fine folks at [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and has been
carefully curated to give you a wide range of colours to choose from. Round of applause for Team
Tailwind! üëè

![Hex tab](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/-fA87N8uDyytFTDQ2eEG_22M3n9SyaBsWA_5Z63WwV)

The **Hex** tab lets you input colours using hex codes. This is especially helpful if you have a
specific colour in mind, or if you're importing a theme from elsewhere.

We hope you enjoy the new colour picker. We've put a lot of work into it, and we think it's a big
improvement over the old one.

We'll see you in the next update!
