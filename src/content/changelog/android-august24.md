Hey chat!

First off, you might've noticed this ✨fancy✨ new changelog sheet that just popped up. You may even
have noticed that it contains this text. Indeed, none of this is a coincidence. We've been working
hard to bring you the best changelog experience possible, and I think we might just have done it.

This comes out of the fact we noticed that we simply _cook too much_ for Google Play, and reached
the character limit right off the bat on our very first changelog. Not this time, Google Play, we
will not be defeated by your character limits!

Of course, we've also been working on some other stuff. Here's a quick rundown of what's new in this
version.

## Image Picker

You might have noticed that the good ol' grid-o-images that we used to have for picking images has
suddenly disappeared by a new and confusing picker picker, something like this:

Sure enough, the rightmost two buttons seem self-explanatory. **Files** lets you pick any file on
your device, and **Camera** lets you take a picture. But what about the leftmost button? The big
**Select Photos** button? Well, that's where the magic happens.

When you tap that button, you'll be presented with Android's new
built-in [photo picker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker).
This picker lets you select photos from your device, Google Photos, and other sources, at least when
those other sources come around to supporting it. Indeed Google has mandated that all apps must use
this picker. So we're getting ahead of the curve and making the switch now.

## Stability Improvements

We've also been working on some stability improvements. We've been working on some stability
improvements. We've been working on some stability improvements. We've been working on some
stability improvements. We've been working on some stability improvements. We've been working on
some stability improvements. We've been working on some stability improvements.

Every time you see this text, it means we've been working on some stability improvements. And you
will see this text a lot in this changelog. Because we've been working on some stability
improvements. Can you guess what we've been working on? That's right, stability improvements.

## Paving the Way for Push Notifications

Push Notifications are really cool. They let you receive notifications even when you're not using
the app. Imagine this: you're out and about, and you get a notification that someone has replied to
your message. Call it fate, call it destiny, but I'll call it pretty cool.

This update ships some of the groundwork for push notifications. We're not quite there yet, but
we're getting there.

## Sidebar

This is the most noticeable change in this update. The sidebar has been completely redesigned. It's
now stringently following the Material Design 3 guidelines on side drawers, and it has pretty
animations and stuff. Tablet users will also notice that unlike most apps, we actually remember
that tablets exist, and the sidebar is optimized for them too.

Here's a screenshot of the new sidebar:

## Bottom Sheet Aesthetic Fix

We've fixed a bug where the bottom sheet would leave an area below it unfilled. This was a visual
bug that was really annoying, and we're glad to have fixed it. Now the bottom sheet will fill the
entire screen, as it should, and when you close it, it will disappear into the void from whence it
came rather than chilling at the bottom of the screen for a second.

## Wrappping Up

That's all for this update. We hope you enjoy the new features and improvements. As always, if you
have any feedback, feel free to let us know in the channels on Jenvolt (the invite you shall find
on the app's "Home" screen or [by clicking here for free](https://rvlt.gg/jen)). We're always
listening and we're always working to make Revolt on Android better.

We'll see you in the next update!
